### Spot Fallacies

#### Third Deadly Sin: Ignorance as Proof
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld made this fallacy famous before the Iraq War, when he said of Saddam Hussein's unfound weapons of mass destruction, "The absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence." Logically, at least, he was correct.  
Scientists and doctors often commit the same sin by assuming that their examples cover all _possible_ example--a mistake appropriately called the **fallacy of ignorance**: what we cannot prove, cannot exist.  
  
  > Doctor: There's nothing wrong with you. The lab tests came back negative.  
    
  > Proof: The lab tests are all negative so. So...  
  > Conclusion: Nothing is wrong with you.  
    
  But a logical chasm lies between the negative tests and perfect health. The proof doesn't support the conclusion. Never mind that you happen to be doubled over in pain and seeing spots; the doctor has no data of illness, so you must be well. The only way to respond to this illogical argument, other than throwing up on his shoes, is to suggest more examples.  
    
> You: Then you must have tested for everything.  
> Doc: Well, not everything...  
> You: Did you test for beriberi?  
> Doc: You don't have beriberi.  
> You: How do you know?  
> Doc: There hasn't been a case of beriberi in the United States since--
> You: But you didn't test for it. So I could be the first.  
> Doc: It _is_ possible, though unlikely, that you may have one of several other diseases.  
> You: So what should we do?
> Doc: We'll run some more tests.  
  
You often see the same fallacy in reverse among unscientific types.  
  
> Believer: Dude, I beleive in extrasensory perception and UFOs because scientists have never disproved them.  
> Proper rhetorical reply: They never disproved that the moon can talk, either.  
> Believer: You think it can?  
> Proper rhetorical reply: Never mind.  

###### What Makes this a Sin
Again, there's a disconnect between the proof and the choice. The examples -- or lack of them -- don't support the choice.
