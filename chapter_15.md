### Call a Foul

#### The Tools
You now have the fallacies of formal logic, and the rhetorical argument breakers. Strangely enough, I came up with seven deadly sins-plus one.  
  
But these rhetorical fouls aren't "wrong," since rhetoric has no real rules. They simply make deliberative argument impossible; that's why I call them fouls, in the sense that they lie out of bounds. The game cannot continue until you're back in bounds. (Grant me the annoying sports metaphor; I haven't used one in a while.) Rhetoric allows occasional sins against logic, but it can't argue the inarguable.  
  
The eight rhetorical out-fo-bounds include  
1. **Switching tenses** away from the future.
2. **Inflexible insistence on the rules**--using the voice of God, sticking to your guns, refusing to hear the other side.  
3. **Humiliation**--an argument that sets out only to debase someone, not make a choice.  
4. **Innuendo.**
5. **Threats.**
6. **Nasty language or signs,** like flipping the bird.
7. **Utter stupidity.**
8. **Truthiness**--the refusal to believe anything that fails to match your opinion.
