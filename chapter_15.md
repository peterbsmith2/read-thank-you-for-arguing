### Call a Foul

#### Foul: The "Right Way"
This foul is closely related to avoiding the future, because it sticks to values--covering Right and Wrong. Who's in and Who's Out--instead of the main topic of deliberative argument, the Advantageous.  
Dorothy Sr. will not want me to mention this, but one of our longest-running arguments has to do with canned peaches on Christmas Eve. For years, she insisted on serving not just peaches, not some other kind of canned fruit, but _canned peaches_ with our Christmas Eve dinner.  
> ME: None of us particularly likes canned peaches. _You_ don't like canned peaches.
> DOROTHY SR: It's what we always had on Christmas Eve.
> ME: It's what _you_ had when you were a kid. _We_ had franks and beans, and you don't see me clamoring for weenies during the holidays.  
> DOROTHY SR: It's tradition, and that's all there is to it.  
> ME: Why can't we start a new tradition? Like fresh pears, or single-malt scotch?  
> DOROTHY JR: (_getting into the spirit_): Or M&M's!  
> DOROTHY SR: If it's new it isn't a tradition.  
> ME: We're celebrating the birth of Jesus! A Christian tradition that began with.._a new baby_.  
> DOROTHY SR: Can't we just enjoy Christmas the right way, without arguing about it?  
  
The "right way" precludes a choice; without choice you have no argument, and therefore it's a rhetorical foul. When your opponent commits use, you have several choices. You can call the foul.  
  
> ME: The "right way" would be a dish that makes everyone happy. Why don't we start a new tradition--one that our children can use to torture their spouses someday?  
  
Or you can bring the argument to an abrupt close--take the ball away, if you will.  
  
> ME: If we can't have a discussion that gets us somewhere, there's no use in talking to you.  
  
Or you can decide that marital relations have precedence over getting your way all the time. This is the option I took: I shut up and ate my peaches. Which, to my surprise, proved to be persuasive. Dorothy was so pleased she had won that, the following Christmas Eve, she served peach pie. It became the new tradition.  

#### The Tools
You now have the fallacies of formal logic, and the rhetorical argument breakers. Strangely enough, I came up with seven deadly sins-plus one.  
  
But these rhetorical fouls aren't "wrong," since rhetoric has no real rules. They simply make deliberative argument impossible; that's why I call them fouls, in the sense that they lie out of bounds. The game cannot continue until you're back in bounds. (Grant me the annoying sports metaphor; I haven't used one in a while.) Rhetoric allows occasional sins against logic, but it can't argue the inarguable.  
  
The eight rhetorical out-fo-bounds include  
1. **Switching tenses** away from the future.
2. **Inflexible insistence on the rules**--using the voice of God, sticking to your guns, refusing to hear the other side.  
3. **Humiliation**--an argument that sets out only to debase someone, not make a choice.  
4. **Innuendo.**
5. **Threats.**
6. **Nasty language or signs,** like flipping the bird.
7. **Utter stupidity.**
8. **Truthiness**--the refusal to believe anything that fails to match your opinion.
