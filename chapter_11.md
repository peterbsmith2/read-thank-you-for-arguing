### Control the Mood
  
Warning: this is kind of a dirty joke. A mean feels sick, so he goes to a clinic.  
  
> Doc: I have good news and bad news.  
> Man: Give me the bad news first.  
> Doc: You have a rare and incurable illness, with less than twenty-four hours to live.  
> Man: My God! What's the good news?  
> Doc: You know that nurse who took your blood pressure, the one with the huge...  
> Man: Yeah, so?  
> Doc: I'm dating her.  
  
Nice bedside manner, dude. It sums up the prevailing enough-about-you-let's-talk-about-me mindset. People often pitch an argument that sounds persuasive to themselves, not to their listeners. This rehtorical mistake can be fatal, because messages that appeal only to the speaker have a tendency to bommerang. You saw how important sympathy is in argument by emotion; the same thing goes with argument by logic. In deliberative argument, you need to convince your audience that the choice you offer is the most advantageous--to the advantage of the audience, that is, not you. This brings us back to values. The advantageous is an outcome that gives the audience what it values.  
###### Argument Tool: THE ADVANTAGEOUS: Base your argument on what's good for the audience, not for you.
  
If you can persuade a two-year-old that eating her oatmeal is to her advantage, for example, then she may actually comply. Suppose the toddler holds the value that older brothers should be taken down a peg.  
  
> You: Eat half your oatmeal and you can fling the bowl at your brother's head.  
  
While your argument may seem morally dubious-and from the brother's point of view, personally objectionable--at least it does what an argument is supposed to do. Aristotle maintained that the person most affected by a decisoin makes the best judge of it. The diner is more qualified to judge a dish than the chef, he said, meaning that the two-year-old outweighs you rhetorically. While the decision is up to the audience, the burden of proof is on you. To prove your point, start with something your audience believes or wants.  
  
Unfortunately, most parents base their arguments on what _they_ want--such as strong bones and healthy bodies. That sounds like Esperanto to two-year-old ears. You want strong bones. She doesn't. What does the kid want? What is to her advantage? And is it worth the trouble of choking down a bowl of oatmeal? That's the stuff of _logos_.  
  
My friend Annie had a _logos_ problem during a recent presidential campaign. Annie grew up in Ohio and now lives on the East Coast. A passionate Democrat, she called all the Ohioans she knew to try to tilt the state. Her former college roommate turned out to be her toughest customer. After chatting about the weather and their families  (weather is topic one in the Midewest), Annie segued into politics.  
  
> Annie: So, Kath, who are you going to vote for in November?  
> Kathy: Oh, I'll vote Republican, I guess.  
> Annie: Kathy, you need to know some reasons I think that would be a mistake.  
  
She ran through a list of problems with the Republicans. Annie was well prepared for this call: logical, concise...  
  
> Kathy: I don't want my taxes to go up.
> Annie: But those tax cuts are causing the deficit to spin out of control!  
> Kathy: I just don't want my taxes to go up.  
> Annie: But they _won't_ go up. All the Democrats want is to let the tax cuts on the rich expire. Let's face it, Kathy, you're married to a lawyer who makes a god-awful amount of money.  
> Kathy (_doing perfect stone wall impression_): If the Democrats get elected, my taxes will go up. And I just don't want them to.  
  
An unpersuadeable audience tends to repeat the same rationale over and over. Is it a good rationale? Doesn't matter. Kathy has made her mind up. She can't be persuaded.  
Or _can_ she?  


#### Cracking Good Clichés
Before you begin an argument, first determine what your audience is thinking. You need to know its beliefs and values, the views it holds in common. The common sense of your audience is square one--the beginning point of your argument. To shift people's point of view, start from their position, not yours. In rhetoric, we call this spot a **commonplace**--a viewpoint your audience holds in common. You can use it as your argument's jumping off point.  

##### Argument Tool: THE COMMONPLACE: Use it as the jumping-off point of your argument.

We equate a commonpalce with a cliché, but the terms once had a broader connotation. The rhetorical commonplace is a short-form expression of common sense or public opinion. It can range from a political belief (all people are created equal) to a practical matter (it's cheaper to buy in bulk). Commonplaces represent beliefs or rules of thumb, not facts; people are created equal only if you agree on the definitions for "created" and "equal," and it's not always cheaper to buy in bulk. A commonplace is not just anything that pops into a person's head, however. "I'm hungry" does not represent a commonplace. But "When I'm hungry, I eat right away" _is_ a commonplace, as is "When I'm hungry, that's good: it means I'm burning fat." Different groups (such as healthy eaters and dieters) have different commonplaces. In fact, people identify with their groups through the groups' commonplaces. These attitudes, beliefs, and values also determine a person's self-identity--the assumptions and outlook on the world that define an individual. We will delve into identity later; right now, let's look at the commonplace as the starting point of rhetorical logic.
