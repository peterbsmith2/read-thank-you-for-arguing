Warning: this is kind of a dirty joke. A mean feels sick, so he goes to a clinic.  
  
> Doc: I have good news and bad news.  
> Man: Give me the bad news first.  
> Doc: You have a rare and incurable illness, with less than twenty-four hours to live.  
> Man: My God! What's the good news?  
> Doc: You know that nurse who took your blood pressure, the one with the huge...

Nice bedside manner, dude. It sums up the prevailing enough-about-you-let's-talk-about-me mindset. People often pitch an argument that sounds persuasive to themselves, not to their listeners. This rehtorical mistake can be fatal, because messages that appeal only to the speaker have a tendency to bommerang. You saw how important sympathy is in argument by emotion; the same thing goes with argument by logic. In deliberative argument, you need to convince your audience that the choice you offer is the most advantageous--to the advantage of the audience, that is, not you. This brings us back to values. The advantageous is an outcome that gives the audience what it values.  
###### Argument Tool: THE ADVANTAGEOUS: Base your argument on what's good for the audience, not for you.
