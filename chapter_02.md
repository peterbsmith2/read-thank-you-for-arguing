### Set Your Goals
  
In a fight, each disputant tries to win. In an argument, they try to _win over_ an audience--which can comprise the onlookers, television viewers, an electorate, or each other.  

#### How to Seduce a Cop
To win a delierative argument, don't try to outscore your opponent. Try instead to get your way.  
  
It's unlikely that your opponent knows any rhetoric. He probably thinks that the sole point of an argument is to humiliate you or get you to admit defeat. This cognitive dissonance can be useful; your opponent's aggressiveness makes a wonderful argument tool. Does he want to score points? Let him score points. All you want to do is win--to get your audience to accept your choice or do what you want it to do. People often win arguments on points, only to lose the battle.
