Salespeople love to use concession to sell you stuff. I once had a boss who came from a sales background. He proved  that old habits die hard. The guy never disagreed with me, yet half the time he got me to do the opposite of what I proposed.
  
> Me: Our research shows that readers love beautiful covers without a lot of type.  
Boss: Beautiful covers. Sure.  
Me: I know that clean covers iolate the usual rules for selling magazines on the newsstand, but we should test dual covers: half of them will be crammed with the usual headlines, and half of them with a big, bold image--very little type.  
Boss: Clean covers. Great idea. How'll that affect your budget?  
Me: It'll cost a lot. I'm gambling on selling more magazines.  
Boss: So you haven't budgeted for it.  
Me: Uh, no. But I tell you, boss, I'm pretty confident about this.  
Boss: Sure. I know you are. Well, it's a great idea. Let's circle back to it at budget time.  
Me: But that's nine months from--  
Boss: So what else is on your agenda?  
  
My covers never got tested. If a circle in hell is reserved for this kind of salesman, it's a pretty darn pleasant one. And despite myself, I never stopped liking the guy. Arguments with him never felt like arguments; I would leave his office in a good mood after losing every point, and he was the one who did all the conceding.
