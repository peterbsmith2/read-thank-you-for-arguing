#### Cicero's Outline

##### Introduction
The _ethos_ part, which wins you the "interest and the good will of the audience," as Cicero puts it. (He calls this section the **exordium**.)
##### Narration
Or statement of facts. Tell the history of the matter or list your facts and figures. If you have the time, do both. This part should be brief, clear, and plausible. Don't repeate yourself. State the facts in chronological order, but don't begin at the beggining of time--just the part that is relevant to the immediate argument. Don't startle the audience with "believe it or not" facts--this part should be predictable. What they hear should sound usual, expected, and natural.
##### Division
List the points where you and your opponent agree and where you disagree. This is where you can get into definitions as well. It's a biological issue. It's an ethical issue. It's a rights issue. It's a practical issue (what benefits our society the most?). It's a fairness issue.
##### Proof
Here is where you get into your actual argument, setting out your argument packet ("We should do this because of that") and your examples.
##### Refutation
Destroy your opponents arguments here.
##### Conclusion
Restate your best points and, if you want, get a little emotional.
