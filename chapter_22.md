### Avoid Apologizing

> **Don't apologize at all.** The problem with an apology is that it belittles you without enlarging your audience. Belittling yourself fails to un-belittle the victim. That's why apologies often don't work. They rarely seem sincere enough or extreme enough. And many people--especially men--try to couch their apoloies in ways that avoid belittling themselves: "I'm really sorry you feel that way." Aplogies like that only increase the belittlement, implying, "I really wish you weren't such a sensitive flower." Try this sometime. Shrink your audience to the size of a plant and watch the anger flow.  

> Whoa, wait. Aren't we splitting a hair or two here? When I told my boss how terrible I felt about misplacing a volcano, wasn't that the same as an apology? Actually, no. Look closely and you will find a crticical difference. When you own up to falling short of your expectations, you emphasize your high standards. Focus on the standards, and you can actually make your _ethos_ bigger in your audience's eyes. Say you're sorry, and you shrink.  

> Still not convinced? Imagine making these two statements to a supervisor:


> > YOU: Boss, you know what a detail person I usually am. In this case, though, I didn't live up to that reputation. My mistake drives me crazy, and I'll be even more fanatical about detail in the future.  

> > YOU: Boss, I screwed up, and I apologize. I'm really, really sorry, and I promise it won't happen again.

> In each instance, how do you think your posture would look? Where would you be looking? I'm guessing you stood up straighter in the first version and you looked pretty hangdog in the second.
