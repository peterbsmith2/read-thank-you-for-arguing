> WHAT BUSH SAID: Part of the facts is understanding we have a problem, and part of the facts is what you're going to do about it.  

> WHAT STUCK IN PEOPLE'S MINDS: ...facts...understanding...problem...facts.  
  
The distracted listener got the impression of an engaged, knowledgeable leader.  
  
Skeptical? Remember that you're receiving this argument in print, a logical medium. A good reader absorbs whole paragraphs, not words or phrases. Imagine hearing a Bushism on television while you make dinner and the dog barks and the kids argue over who got to use the PlayStation last and you woner whether it's timeto get an oil change.
