Other emotions--such as joy, love, esteem, and compassion--work better, Aristotle said. Some people tend to revel in them, while others start fund drives. Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy showed the power of compassion, but a disaster carries more force than an argument. When you want action to come out of argument, your most useful emotions arouse peopel's tribal instincts--exploiting their insecurities about where they stand in a group, and how much they belong to it. I mentioned in an earlier chapter that you want the audience to identify with you and, through you, the action you promote. This is why Aristotle listed *anger, patriotism,* and *emulation* among emotions that can get an audience out of its seats and make it do what you want.

A person who desires something is especially susceptible to *anger*. Frustrate her ability to assuage that desire, Aristotle said, and you have an angry person. (Try withholding ice cream from a feisty daughter.) Young people have more desires than old people, so they rouse to anger more easily. Ditto the poor and the site.

###### Argument Tool: BELITTLEMENT CHARGE: Show your opponent dissing your audience's desires. 

The easiest way to stimulate anger, Aristotle went on, is to belittle that desire. Keep in mind that he lived in a culture that resembles the modern street gang--macho, violent, and sensitive to any slight. Disrespect an ancient Greek or an ancient Greek's woman, and you should be prepared to hop the next trireme. But for the purposes of persuasion, the kind of anger that comes from belittlement is especially useful. If you want a hospital patient to sue a doctor, convince the patient that the doc neglected to take her problem seriously. Most personal lawsuits arise out of this sense of belittlement. It's an identification thing: people who feel themselves being cast out by the elite will go to great lengths to restore their status. (Later on, you'll see how belittlement leads people to demand an apology--and why you often shouldn't give one.)

A few weeks after writing this, I am scheduled to testify before the New Hampshire legislature on broadband Internet access in rural areas. I like to tell people that my dial-up connection here is so slow, a stamped envelope gets delivered faster than email. (That literally happened once.) The problem is the phone company, which holds a monopoly in this state. Its lobbyists oppose any plan that would create competition; on the other hand, the company does nothing to bring broadband to my area. Which of these two statements has the best chance of getting a law that forces the company to provide statewide broadband?

> Me: The company shows it couldn't care less about rural customers like me.

> Me: The company has mocked this legislature for years, saying, "Sure, we'll provide broadband, leave it to us," and then forgetting you the moment it leaves this hearing room.

Actually, both might work, and I might use them. But which argument will make the representatives angriest at the phone company? I vote for number two; as Aristotle would say, the state reps would feel personally belittled. 

On the other hand, I may play down the _pathos_ in my testimony. Anger gets the fastest action, which is a reason why most political advertising tries to make you mad. The problem is, while angry people are quick on the trigger, they tend not to think far ahead; hence the crime of passion. So anger isn't the best emotion for deliberative argument, where we make decisions about the future. The Greeks reserved it for courtroom rhetoric, when they wanted someone to hang.

*Patriotism* does a much better job of looking into the future. This rhetorical group loyalty doesn't have to be all about country. You can be patriotic for a high school, a British soccer team, or--rarely these days--a company. Do not confuse it with idealism, belief in an idea. That's the realm of _logos_, not _pathos_. Soldiers have died for democracy and freedom, indeed, but their patriotism burns for a country, not an idea--the Stars and Bars, not the Constitution. An effective argument against flag burning is bound to be emotional, because it's all about zeal for country. An argument to _allow_ flag burning must use _logos_ more than _pathos_, because it emphasizes ideals more than patriotism.
