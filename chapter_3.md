### Control The Tense  

_Pg 28:_
> The examples I gave of the core issues--blame, values, and choice--show a certain pattern. The blame questions deal with the past. The values questions are in the present tense. And the choice questions have to do with the future.

> **Blame = _Past_  Values = _Present_  Choice = _Future_**  
  
> If you find an argument spinning out of control, try switching the tense. To pin the blame on the cheese thief, use the past tense. To get someone to believe that abortion is a terrible sin, use the present tense. The future, though, is the best tense for getting peace and quiet in the living room.
