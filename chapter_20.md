### Make Them Identify with Your Choice

> For one thing, overuse of identity leads to groupthink--where bonding, rather than the "advantageous," governs decisions. This is the danger of arguing demonstratively, in the present tense. If the aim is identity, then the whole point of persuasion is to make everyone eager to belong-- the ultimate source of yes-men and -women.
